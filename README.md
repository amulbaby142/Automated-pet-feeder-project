# 🐾 Automated Pet Feeder System

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the design and simulation of a low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder for cats and dogs. The system is intended for use in animal shelters to dispense food at scheduled times, monitor consumption, and alert staff if issues arise.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Dispense food at scheduled times (e.g., 8 AM and 6 PM).
- Monitor food consumption using sensors.
- Alert staff if food is not dispensed or not eaten.
- Simulate logic using flowcharts and word-based code before hardware implementation.
